This is a Real-Time Online Chat Application, where users can join chatrooms and make conservations.

React.js is used on the Frontend, while Node.js, Express.js and Socket.io is employed to build a robust server-side infrastructure. I explored the use of websockets in implementing bidirectional events between client and server, enabling seamless communication for instant mesage delivery and chat updates.

# Setting up:

## Server Side
In the server side directory (\chat-app\server),
To install all dependencies, run:
### `npm i`

To start the server, run: 
### `npm start`

Alternatively, you may run: 
### `node index.js`


This runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.




## Client Side
In the client side directory (\chat-app\client), open another terminal.

To install all dependencies, run: 
### `npm i` 

To start running the app, run:
### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
