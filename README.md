Chat X Tgt is a Real-Time chat app, where anyone can create an account and chat away!
React.js is used for the Frontend, while Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io and MongoDB are employed to build a robust server-side infrastructure. I explored the use of websockets in implementing bidirectional events between client and server, enabling seamless communication for instant mesage delivery and updates such as online activity and last seen statuses.

More Features: Work In progress
